Then, it pinpoints the eye area using a facial landmarks detector. Next, it calculates and analyzes the eye aspect ratio for each frame. Afterward, three types of classifiers—linear SVM and sequential neural network—are used to enhance accuracy. The data is then classified to determine whether the driver's eyes are open or closed. The system detects closed eyes for a set period within each second, tallying the amount of drowsy blinks persisting within or throughout the seconds. The amount of drowsy blinks per minute is then quantified. More than even one drowsy blink should urge you to reconsider driving."
